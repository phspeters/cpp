BANANA PANCAKES

You hardly even notice when I try to show you this song it's meant to keep you from
doing what your supposed to.
Like waking up too early, maybe we could sleep in,
make your banana pancakes, pretend like it's the weekend now.
And we could pretend it all the time.
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside.
But just maybe, like a ukulele, mama made a baby.
Really don't mind to practice, 'cause you're my little ladie.
Ladie, ladie love me, 'cause I love to lay here lazy.
We could close the curtains, pretend like there's no world outside.
And we could pretend it all the time, yeah.
Cant you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside.
Ain't no need, ain't no need
hmm, hmm.
Can't you see, can't you see?
Rain all day and I don't mind.
But the telephone singing, ringing, it's too early don't pick it up.
We don't need to.
We got everything we need right here and everything we need it's enough.
Just so easy when the whole world fits inside of your arms.
Do you really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up slow. Hmm, wake up slow.
But baby, you hardly even notice when I try to show you this song it's meant to keep
you from doing what your suppossed to.
Like waking up to early, maybe we could sleep in.
Make you banana pancakes, pretend like it's the weekend now.
And we could pretend it all the time.
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside.
Ain't no need, ain't no need.
Rain all day and I really, really, really don't mind.
Can't you see, can't you see?
We gotta wake up slow.
