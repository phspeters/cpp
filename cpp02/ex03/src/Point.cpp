/**
 * @brief Calculate the side of a point relative to the line (a->b) by using the cross product of 2D vectors.
 * The cross product of two 2D vectors (a,b) and (c,d) is defined as: (a,b) Ã— (c,d) = a.d - b.c
 * and the result is a scalar value, which is positive if the angle between the two vectors is
 * positive (counter-clockwise) and negative if the angle between the two vectors is negative (clockwise).
 * Our line is defined by two points 'a' and 'b', and we want to know on which side of the line a point 'p'
 * is located. We can use the cross product of the vectors (a,p) and (a,b) to determine this.
 * The formula for it is (b.x - a.x) * (p.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (p.x - a.x) where x and y represent the
 * coordinates of the points.
 * 
 * @param this The point to check.
 * @param a The starting point of the line.
 * @param b The ending point of the line.
 * @return signed double. If the result is positive, the point is on the "left side" of the line, if it
 * is negative, the point is on the "right side" of the line.
