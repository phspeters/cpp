## 💡 About the project

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming. This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C. Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will comply with the C++98 standard.  
We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common Core!  
You will discover new concepts step-by-step. The exercises will progressively increase in complexity.

## 💭 Main concepts from each module

- **cpp00:** Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streamsinitialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff

- **cpp01:** Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement

- **cpp02:** Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form

- **cpp03:** Inheritance

- **cpp04:** Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

- **cpp05:** Repetition and Exceptions

- **cpp06:** C++ casts

- **cpp07:** C++ templates

- **cpp08:** Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

- **cpp09:** STL

## 🚫 Project constraints

- C++11 (and derived forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden.
- The using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords are forbidden
- From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated otherwise.
- You are allowed to use the STL in the Module 08 and 09 only. That means: no Containers (vector/list/map/and so forth) and no Algorithms (anything that requires to include the <algorithm> header) until then.

## 📋 Testing

To compile, navigate to the exercise directory and run:

```shell
$ make 
```

Then, execute the newly compiled program.
